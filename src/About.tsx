        A stalk of corn waiting for harvest started as a seed; our
        community&apos;s the same. We&apos;re planting the seed of brighter
        tomorrows today. The Newport Farmers&apos; Market gives local vendors
        and farmers a place to come together and celebrate good, hard, honest
        work - the work done by the hands of our neighbors. Come out and help us
        grow!

      <div className="text-justify">
        In 1978 the Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act directed the
        Cooperative Extension Service to become involved in farm-direct
        marketing by helping to organize local farmers markets. Newport Farmers
        Market opened that year, one of the first in the state to do so. A
        handful of local farmers gathered at the Fairgrounds and sold out all of
        their produce in two hours! The Lincoln County Small Farmers Association
        (LCSFA), which operates the Newport Farmers Market, was formed the
        following year with the help of the Oregon State University Extension
        Service and by the second season included 40 memberships. Today the
        LCSFA has an active membership of approximately 60 vendors.
