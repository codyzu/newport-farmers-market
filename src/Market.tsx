        Come visit us on Saturdays throughout the year-long growing season and
        you will see we have something for everyone. Rain or Shine! Our farmers
        offer diverse, high-quality, seasonal & locally grown produce, meat,
        eggs, and honey. Meet our local farmers, eat some delicious prepared
        food, buy one-of-a-kind handcrafted items, chat with Master Gardeners,
        listen to local musicians, and catch up with friends and neighbors while
        stocking up on fresh produce. Experience our local coastal flavor and
        see what makes us one of the great events Newport has to offer.
